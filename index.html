<p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...<p>

<h3>HTML is cool</h3>
<h3>CSS is cooler</h3>
<h3>JS is the best</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h2>What do you need to create a website?</h2>

<h4>Not much!</h4>
<p>A computer (always a good start)</p>
<p>A text editor (I am using atom)</p>
<p>A web browser (I am using chrome)</p>
<p>Some HTML, CSS and JS files<p/>
</div>
<h3>Follow my progress on github</h3>
